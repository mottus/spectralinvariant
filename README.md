# spectralinvariant

(hyper)spectral data processing with spectral invariants (p-theory)

## Installation
I haven't yet made an official pip package of `spectralinvariant`. But here's how you can install the package on your system locally:

- Clone this repo to your machine via GitHub Desktop or using git:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/mottus/spectralinvariant

```

- Install the package in your repo directory using pip:

```shell
/spectralinvariant$ pip install -e .
```

The `-e` flag makes pip install the package locally, i.e., in the `src` directory, __NOT__ within your Python distribution.
