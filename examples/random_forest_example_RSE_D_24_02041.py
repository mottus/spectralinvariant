"""
This example shows how to use the spectral invariant theory and random forest regression to retrieve the true leaf reflectance from a Top-of-Canopy (TOC) reflectance hyperspectral image using the method from Ihalainen et al (2024).
Originally created by Olli Ihalainen (2024)

Note that unlike in the paper, we do not apply a sunlit fraction mask in this example.
